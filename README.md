# Deathwing

> Pain... Agony.... My hatred burns through the cavernous deeps. The world heaves with my torment. Its wretched kingdoms quake beneath my rage... But at last... The whole of Azeroth will break... ...And all will burn beneath the shadow of my wings...

*<small>Deathwing the Destroyer</small>*

Deathwing is a small project developed to be used as a living guide or reference on how to build a single web application over [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) technologies, and is hosted as a [SAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) where any agile team can use the actual retrospective application tool for their projects.
